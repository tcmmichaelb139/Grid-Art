# Grid Art

Create art with grids.

## Screenshots

Screenshots work properly. I would recommend filling every square with a color before saving though.

## How Its Made

This grid art application uses tables to draw each square. This causes problems with moving a mouse quickly across the screen causing it not register, so move slowly and carefully.
